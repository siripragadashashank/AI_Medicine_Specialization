    "In this week's assignment, you'll be using a network architecture called \"U-Net\". The name of this network architecture comes from it's U-like shape when shown in a diagram like this (image from [U-net entry on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net)): \n",

    "U-nets are commonly used for image segmentation, which will be your task in the upcoming assignment. You won't actually need to implement U-Net in the assignment, but we wanted to give you an opportunity to gain some familiarity with this architecture here before you use it in the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the diagram, this architecture features a series of down-convolutions connected by max-pooling operations, followed by a series of up-convolutions connected by upsampling and concatenation operations. Each of the down-convolutions is also connected directly to the concatenation operations in the upsampling portion of the network. For more detail on the U-Net architecture, have a look at the original [U-Net paper by Ronneberger et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). \n",
